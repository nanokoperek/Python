The largest X values ​​over the entire period are value1, value2, value3, valueX for year1, year2, year3 and yearX respectively. Accordingly, the X of the smallest values ​​over the entire time period is value1, value2, value3, valueX for year1, year2, year3, yearX. The average of column_name is average_value and the sum of column_name in all periods equals to sum_value. The difference between the smallest and largest value column_name is diff_minmax.
